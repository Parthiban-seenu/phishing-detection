# phishing-detection

Detecting the website's security accuracy:

To be in brief, the data are fetched from a preloaded wesite's data stored in csv file in the form of binary these are trained, processed and obtained using three algorithms.

1. Random forest
2. Decision tree
3. Logistic regression

language - python
done with social engineering and tech. Attackers use these sites look like genuine but it as phishing attach
Random forest is a suprevised learning algorithm it helps to train the data this helps to predict the result better this builds many decision tree
The attackers target the user in fake website which looks similar in that case decision tree is usedT
Then logistic regression is to predict the binary data
Logistic regression output - 
Variable importance is calculated by the sum of the decrease in error when split by a variable. 
Then, the relative importance is the variable importance divided by the highest variable importance value so that values are bounded between 0 and 1.

The accuracy is predicted, compared and found best algorithm.
